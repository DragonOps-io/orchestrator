# DragonOps Orchestrator

The orchestrator is responsible for managing the execution of the various tasks that are required to deploy 
DragonOps infrastructure. It is written in Golang and runs as an ECS task in the `dragonops` cluster. 

It is open source for visibility into how DragonOps works and what is being executed in client accounts.
